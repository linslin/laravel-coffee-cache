Store based lever out view cache for **Laravel 4.x, 5.x 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x and 10.x**. This cache hook in before composer autoload and 
Laravel bootstrapping. It will push your application into light speed. By default, all GET-Requests will be cached.

It's a coffee cache. You can drink more coffee instead of spending time to optimize your application or server 
environment. Mokka Mokka!

## Why and when should I use laravel-coffee-cache?
Laravel getting bigger and bigger over the years. Today laravel is a very nice framework which helps you to speed up your
software development and programming in its best way. On the other hand laravel is slow in handling requests and consumes
a lot of memory per request, even if you use View or Database caches. The bootstrapping of laravel takes a bit time
also it consumes a lot of memory. E.g. if you want to render an "imprint / disclaimer" page which doesn't have any 
dynamic data in its view. So, why you want to bootstrap laravel and all its dependencies just for returning a simple
HTML page?

☕ **laravel-coffee-cache** allows you to lever out laravel and composer autoload completely once a cache file has been
generated for a specific route (Request URI). In this way it consumes so much less hardware resources (CPU, RAM, Hard Disk) 
for each request. It will be push your application into light speed. 

**The difference to existing cache systems for laravel is:** You don't need to have a DB cache based on memcached or 
even a view file based cache placed in a laravel middleware. **Hint:** It's nice approach is to combine your DB Cache with 
**laravel-coffee-cache**. Use your DB Cache even if you have **laravel-coffee-cache** running in the foreground. 

You will be able to create highly frequented web applications and save a lot of hardware resources 
(which also saves money) with ☕ **laravel-coffee-cache**. It makes to optimize your applications if your website is too slow
or your server / server capacities (CPU, Memory) run at full load. Give it a try. 

## Installation
    composer require --prefer-dist linslin/laravel-coffee-cache "*"
    
## Register Facade
If you want to use the facade to handle the cache files, add 
this to your facades in `config/app.php` in the `alias` array:

    'CoffeeCache' => linslin\CoffeeCache\Facades\CoffeeCache::class,
    
## Example `./config/coffeeCache.php` config file

    return [
    
        /**
         * Cache driver: 'file' or 'redis'
         */
        'driver' => 'file',
    
        /*
         * Redis connection
         */
        'redis' => [
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'port' => 6000,
            'password' => '', //leave empty if no password is given
            'timeout' => 0.5
        ],
    ];

## API Documentation 

#### Initialize instance
Should be placed in your `app/public/index.php` file.

    $coffeeCache = new CoffeeCache(__DIR__);
    
#### Configure enabled hosts for caching [optional]
Matching hosts which should be cached. Default: Cache all domains

    $coffeeCache->enabledHosts = [
        'www.production.com',
        'subdomain.production.com',
    ];

## Facade API Documentation

### Delete all cache files
   
    CoffeeCache::clearCache();

### Manually delete cache files 

    CoffeeCache::clearCacheFile(route('route.name', [], false));
    
### Check if cache file exist 

    CoffeeCache::cacheFileExists(route('route.name', [], false));
    
### Get creation date (file driver only)

    CoffeeCache::getCacheFileCreatedDate(route('route.name', [], false));
       

#### Example: Manually delete cache a specific file
E.g. inside a controller - example:

    <?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin\Shop;
    
    use App\Models\Shop;
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    use linslin\CoffeeCache\Facades\CoffeeCache;
    
    /**
     * Class EntryController
     * @package App\Http\Controllers\Admin
     */
    class EntryController extends ShopBaseController
    {
    
        /**
         * @param Request $request
         * @param Shop $shop
         * @return \Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application|\Illuminate\Contracts\View\Factory|\Illuminate\View\View
         */
        public function update(Request $request, Shop $shop)
        {
            //manually delete cache file for a route (if exists)
            CoffeeCache::clearCacheFile(route('shop.show', ['shop' => $shop->slug], false));
    
            return view('admin.shop.form',[
                'shop' => $shop,
            ]);
        }
    }


## Setup and usage

- Create a cache folder name `coffeeCache` in `app/storage/`. So you have this folder created: `/storage/coffeeCache`.
- Add a `.gitignore` in `/storage/coffeeCache` and put [this contents](https://github.com/linslin/laravel-coffee-cache/blob/master/app/storage/coffeeCache/.gitignore) into. 
- Edit your `app/public/index.php` and add this lines on the top of your PHP script:

    ```php
    require_once './../vendor/linslin/laravel-coffee-cache/CoffeeCache.php';
    
    $coffeeCache = new CoffeeCache(__DIR__);
    $coffeeCache->cacheTime = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1; //Default is one day. 60 * 60 * 24 * 1 = 1 day
    $coffeeCache->minifyCacheFile = true;
    $coffeeCache->enabledHosts = [
        'www.production.com',
        'subdomain.production.com',
    ]; // optional, leave this array empty if you want to cache all domains.
    $coffeeCache->enabledHttpStatusCodes = [
      '200',
      '202',
    ]; // list of HTTP-Status codes which should be cached.
    $coffeeCache->excludeUrls = [
        '/admin',
    ]; // URL pattern of URLs which should not be cache. This example will exclude URLS which have "/admin" somewhere in the URL. 
    $coffeeCache->handle();
    ```
    Replace all code lines under `$kernel = $app->make('Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel');` with this lines:
    ```php
    /** @var Illuminate\Http\Response $response */
    $response = $kernel->handle(
        $request = Illuminate\Http\Request::capture()
    );
    
    if ($coffeeCache->isCacheAble()) {
        $coffeeCache->httpStatusCode = $response->status();
        $coffeeCache->contentType = $response->headers->get('content-type');
        $response->sendHeaders();
        echo $response->content();
    } else {
        $response->send();
    }
    
    $kernel->terminate($request, $response);
    
    $coffeeCache->finalize();
    ```
    You can also compare your edits with this [example index.php](https://github.com/linslin/laravel-coffee-cache/blob/master/app/public/index.php). 
    
    **In the end your `app/public/index.php` should look like this:**
    ```php
    <?php
    require_once './../vendor/linslin/laravel-coffee-cache/CoffeeCache.php';
    
    $coffeeCache = new CoffeeCache(__DIR__);
    $coffeeCache->cacheTime = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1; //Default is one day. 60 * 60 * 24 * 1 = 1 day
    $coffeeCache->minifyCacheFile = true;
    $coffeeCache->enabledHosts = [
      'www.production.com',
      'subdomain.production.com',
    ]; // optional, leave this array empty if you want to cache all domains.
    $coffeeCache->enabledHttpStatusCodes = [
    '200',
    '202',
    ]; // list of HTTP-Status codes which should be cached.
    $coffeeCache->excludeUrls = [
        '/admin',
    ]; // URL pattern of URLs which should not be cache. This example will exclude URLS which have "/admin" somewhere in the URL. 
    $coffeeCache->handle();
    
    
    require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/autoload.php';
    $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
    $kernel = $app->make('Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel');
    
    /** @var Illuminate\Http\Response $response */
    $response = $kernel->handle(
        $request = Illuminate\Http\Request::capture()
    );
    
    if ($coffeeCache->isCacheAble()) {
        $coffeeCache->httpStatusCode = $response->status();
        $coffeeCache->contentType = $response->headers->get('content-type');
        $response->sendHeaders();
        echo $response->content();
    } else {
        $response->send();
    }
    
    $kernel->terminate($request, $response);
    
    $coffeeCache->finalize();
    ```
- laravel-coffee-cache should now start to cache your GET Requests and creating cache files in `app/storage/coffeeCache`.
- Create a config file in `./config/coffeeCache.php`. An example config can be found in this repository.
